    "strength is an float number which corresponds to how strong a team is upon a 100 scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "manager is the name of the team manager in string. \n",

    "\n",
    "Each FootballTeam class has 4 methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "form() generates a random float value between 0 to 100, and updates it as the strength variable. If there is no manager in the team, form() generates a float value between 0 to 70. If the last known value in record is 'W', the strength is increased by 10%. If the last known value in record is 'D' or there is no prior record, there is no change in the strength. If the last known value in the record is 'L', the strength is decreased by 10%.\n",

    "\n",
    "hire() checks if there is no manager in the team, and generates a random number between 1 to 3. If the value is 2 and there is no manager in the team, the team hires a manager called \"Jorden\".\n",

This should be done upon instantiation of the Winner object.\n",
